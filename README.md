# Team-Singularity
Deep Learning Multiple Diseases Prediction Model based on Retina Image
Quick Start
Chech out the folder for pytorch implementations. These implementations are designed to run on google's colab platform. Users are encouraged to modify the setup section in order to run the notebooks locally.
### Data Set
Check out data sets in the given link 
https://www.kaggle.com/nikkich9/derbi-hackathon-retinal-fundus-image-dataset
### Execution Procedure
Download the dataset from given link and execute .ipynb file
### Note
Dont run the training cell in code if you are running inference or testing only
** If you want to test just keep the saved weights file named "resnet50.pth" in the same folder as that of code file. **
